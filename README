# squashbackup

This repository contains a script that can generate squashfs archives containing backups of disks, disk partitions and
other block devices. The script is mostly tailored for my own needs, and really just uploaded here so I can host a
package somewhere, but you might find it useful.

I won't be responsible if this package somehow erases your disk, erases your backup, attempts to convince you to feed
it hamburgers or makes your dog speak Basque.

Everything in this repository is released to the public domain under [the Unlicense](LICENSE).
